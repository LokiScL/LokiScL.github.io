The goal is to develop a 100% mobile site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants.
The development must be done in CSS, without javascript, without framework and no CSS code must be applied in the HTML. The site will be developed using the mobile-first approach and will have to adapt to tablets and desktops.
The entire site must be responsive, pass W3C validation in HTML and CSS, and be compatible with the latest desktop versions of Chrome and Firefox.

<!-- FEATURES -->
## Requested features

### Buttons

- On hover, the background color of the main buttons should lighten slightly. The shadow should also be more visible.
- Eventually, visitors will be able to save their favorite menus. For this, a heart-shaped "Like" button is present on the model. On click, it should gradually fill. For this first version, the effect can appear on hover instead of click.

### Homepage

- When the application has more menus, a “loading spinner” will be necessary. On this model, we want to get a glimpse of it. It should appear for 1 to 3 seconds when you arrive on the home page, cover the entire screen, and use CSS animations (no library). The design of this loader is not defined, any proposal is therefore welcome as long as it is consistent with the graphic charter of the site.

### Menu's pages

- Upon arrival on the page, the dishes should appear gradually with a slight time lag. They can either appear one by one, or by group “Starter”, “Main course” and “Dessert”.
- Visitors can add the dishes they want to their order by clicking on them. This brings up a small checkmark to the right of the dish. This tick should slide from right to left. For this first version, the effect can appear on hover instead of click. If the dish title is too long, it will need to be trimmed with an ellipsis.
